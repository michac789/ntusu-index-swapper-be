        Get all unique courses code and name (not index!) from all CourseIndex instances.
        All query parameters (pagination / filter / sort) from courseindex_list api are also available here.

        - If any pair is found, email both users that pair has been found

        Expected input data:
        - **contact_info**: _string (max 100 characters)_
            expected contact information preferred by user such as telegram username, phone number, or email
            currently it is free text (no specific format validation)
        - **contact_type**: _string (max 1 character)_
            either 'E' (email) or 'T' (telegram) or 'P' (phone / WhatsApp)
        - **current_index**: _string (max 5 characters)_
            course index that the user currently has and wants to be swapped,
            must be a valid course index (all indexes are unique),
            this user don't have an ongoing SwapRequest with the same index (status S or W)
        - **wanted_indexes**: _list of strings (max 5 characters each, min 1 item in list)_
            list of course indexes that the user wants to swap to,
            each of those index should be valid, should not be the same as current index,

        - Return 409 if user has an ongoing SwapRequest with the same index (status S or W)
        - Return 400 if any of the index in wanted_indexes is invalid, or if it is the same as current index,
            or if any of the index in wanted_indexes is not the same course code and at least one wanted_index needed,

        What this endpoint does:
        - Edit only the `contact_info` and `contact_type` of a SwapRequest instance

        - Current SwapRequest status is 'W' (waiting), means that a pair is found,
        but the pair can't be contacted or has other objection that the swap failed
        - User still wants to search another pair, so this endpoint is called

        What this endpoint does:

        It is used in this scenario:
        - Current SwapRequest status is 'W' (waiting), means that a pair is found,

        It is used in this scenario:
        - Current SwapRequest status is 'W' (waiting) or 'S' (searching),
